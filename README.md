## Carbon Tutorial Angular
This tutorial will guide you in creating an Angular app with the [Carbon Design System](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/). Weâ€™ll teach you the ins and outs of using Carbon components, while introducing web development best practices along the way.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:4200 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles Angular in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

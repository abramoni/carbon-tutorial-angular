# Issue
- Current PWA settings are breaking localhost version in Chrome (freezing and just saying: 'Loading...'), but it seems to work fine in Microsoft Edge browser
- when experimenting in sandbox without PWA it seems to work fine in Chrome
- downside in Edge: seems to cache and not refresh page -> use private window to avoid cache
